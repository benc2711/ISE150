        How to slice them
            This is where you use the colon and brackets [5:13} 
            Includes 5 does not include 13
            using [:5] prints up to 5 but not including 5 
            like wise using [5:] prints after 5
        Some of the functions we have been using like find lower capitalize and split
        Need to know about adding to them
        Need to know about their features like if they are mutable
